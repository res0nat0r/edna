Changes since 0.4

  - "New since $DATE" is now available as a config option
  - don't log requests for picture_extensions
  - Experimental ID3-Tag support (in default_complex.ezt template)
    Known problems:
                  - (doesn't work with ogg, a workaround is included, MP3Info 
		    is used not OggInfo because OggInfo doesn't has 
		    songs.info.mpeg.* informations)
                  - with some of my mp3 files I get a MemoryError 
		    exception --> catch and print warning
		    
  - Catch KeyboardInterrupt exception and print a exit message.
  - Debug messages and a config option to enable them
  - Urls are now linked and unquoted in the status page
