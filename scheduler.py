  A class whose instances are meant to be run in their own thread, which
  repetetively schedules calls to a single action function.  It differs
  from the sched module in that calls to the function are repeated every
  interval instead of being called once, and that the scheduler can be
  stopped even when the underlying platform's time.sleep() call is not
  interruptable.
  Users of this class will have to do the right thing as far as setting
  up signal handlers and catching interrupts.

    Create and initialize a new scheduler object.  The caller will need to 
    call Thread.start() on it to create a thread to start scheduling actions.
    The scheduler calls action(action_args) once right when it's started,
    then every 'interval' seconds starting 'offset' seconds after midnight.
    For example scheduler(3 * 3600, 24 * 3600, foo, ['bar'], 10) will cause
    foo to be called once a day at 3am.
    The 'sleep_quantum' argument determines how long the thread will sleep
    between checks for whether the thread has been requested to stop.  This
    is needed because, on some platforms, calls to time.sleep() are not
    interrupted.
